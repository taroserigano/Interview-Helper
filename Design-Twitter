-----DESIGN TWITER----- 

500m users
200m active users 
20m active writers 

Tweets- 

characters & meta data & video/img 


WRITE

-each Tweet: 100 bytes / avg 1 mb 

text: 20 million * 1kb  = 20 GB / day 
text&media: 20 million * 1mb = 20 tb / day 




 
READ: 
-Times: 200m users read * 100 tweets = 20 billion tweets read (tweets read)  
-Data Used: text-only: 20 billions * 1 byte = 200 GB 
            text&media: 20b * 1mb = 20PB/day  


FUNCTIONS:  
createTweet - [Text, media, timestamp] 
getFeed(UID) 
follow(UID) - followed and following 


DB: 

indexes - following users 

Read-only Replicas 

Sharding key - based on User ID, instead of Tweet ID 
request specific ID's tweets 



create Tweet scenario: 

1. User creates a tweet, server creates in DB 
2. Based on the UID, DB stores the tweet on the shard (UID-based), media on S3 

Read Tweets

1. we may have to go through multiple shards for different users' tweets
2. Caching helps as well as LRU with timestamps 



Performance Boost (ASYNC) for new tweets 

-whenever user creates a new tweet, 
pub/sub queue - update followee's tweet list on followers 

-> Spark Cluster -> new Tweets Cache 

*probably caching can supplement's new Tweets Cache simultaneously

KMS - 

0. use the customer master key 
1. provides Custome Master Key. 
2. data will be encrypted into ciphertext with encryption algorithm
3. this generates encrypted data key and plaintext data key. plaintext data key will be dismissed 
*plaindata text key can decrypt the ciphertext 

-When Decrypt 

1. use the customer master key again 
2. decrypt the encrypted data key with decryption algo.
3. this turns encrypted into plaintext data key
4. use this to decrypt the cypher text 


Also, KSM is integrated with Cloud Trail, all API calls get recorded
